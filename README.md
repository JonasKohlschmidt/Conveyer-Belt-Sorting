# Conveyer-Belt-Sorting
The goal of this university project was to enable a sorting machine to sort wooden sticks according to their length. The machine consists 
of a conveyer belt to transport the sticks, a moveable skid to slide the sticks to different end positions (e.g. boxes) and a sensor to 
measure the length of the sticks during their transport on the conveyer belt.

Controllers to maneuver the moveable parts have been designed, tested, and implemented in C RTAI Linux.
